## Graphs

**node/vertices** : unit that represents an entity, object, or data point

**edge** : connection between nodes

**path** : sequence of distinct adjacent nodes

**neighbor** of a node : another node that is directly connected to it

### Undirected Graphs

**_Graphs built upon a finite set of vertices and edges_**

types of undirected graphs

- complete graphs : every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge

```
(A)---(B)
 | \   |
 |  \  |
 |   \ |
(C)---(D)
```

- path graphs : consists of vertices arranged in a straight line
```
(A)---(B)---(C)---(D)---(E)
```
- cycle graphs : closed loop where each vertex has EXACTLY two neighbors
```
(A)---(B)
 |     |
(E)---(C)
  \   /
   (D)
```
- star graphs : one central vertex connected to all other vertices
```
     (A)
     /|\
    / | \
(B)  (C)  (D)
     (E)
```
- tree graphs : exactly one path between any two vertices
```
      (A)
     /   \
   (B)   (C)
  /   \     \
(D)   (E)   (F)
```

**bipartite graphs** : vertices divided into two sets with edges between the sets
```
(A)   (B)   (C)
 |     |     |
 |     |     |
(X)---(Y)---(Z)
```

### Spanning Graphs

_**Subgraph that includes all the vertices of the original graph while being connected**_

```
(A)---(B)       (A)---(B)
 |   / |         |
 |  /  |    ->   |
 | /   |         |    
(C)---(D)       (C)---(D)
```

Types of spanning subgraphs

- spanning tree : minimal connected subgraph of a graph that contains all its vertices but has no cycles (has $n - 1$ edges where $n$ is the number of nodes )
    - graph is **connected** if a spanning tree exists on the graph

**non-spanning subgraph** : subgraph that DOES NOT include all the vertices of the original graph

- a subset of the original but will exclude some vertices

### Directed Graphs

_**Graphs where the edges are given directions**_

characteristics of a directed graph

- tail : the starting vertex $\mathbf{u}$
- head : the ending vertex $\mathbf{v}$
- path : sequence of edges where each edge's head matches the next edge's tail
- adjacency : if there is a directed edge $(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})$, then 
    - $\mathbf{u}$ is adjacent to $\mathbf{v}$
    - $\mathbf{v}$ is not necessarily adjacent to $\mathbf{u}$
- neighborhood : set of vertices that are directly reachable from the vertex via a directed edge
    - out of $\mathbf{v}$ : set of vertices that **$\mathbf{v}$ points to**
    - in of $\mathbf{v}$ : set of vertices that **point to $\mathbf{v}$**

**subgraph**: consists of a subset of a directed graph's vertices and edges while maintaining the direction

**strongly connected** : every vertex is reachable from every other vertex via directed path

**weakly connected** : the opposite of a strongly connected graph

- only share the connected property with strongly connected if the graph is undirected 

### Laplacian Matrix

_**Matrix representation of a graph that captures its structure, connectivity, and properties**_

For a graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, its Laplacian matrix $L$ is defined as 

$$L = D - A$$

where

- $D$ = degree matrix : number of edges per vertex on the diagonal
- $A$ = adjacency matrix : shows which vertices are connected by an edge

Ex:

Given graph $G$

```
(1)---(2)
 | \   |
 |  \  |
 |   \ |
(3)---(4)
```

Then the adjacency matrix $A$ will be ...

$$
A = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
0 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\  
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 
1 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 1 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

... and the degree matrix $D$ will be ...

$$
D = 
\begin{bmatrix} 
3 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\  
0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 
1 & 0 & 2 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 3
\end{bmatrix}
$$

... therefore the Laplacian Matrix $L$ is ...

$$
L = 
D - A =  
\begin{bmatrix} 
3 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\  
-1 & 2 & 0 & -1 \\ 
-1 & 0 & 2 & -1 \\
-1 & -1 & -1 & 3
\end{bmatrix} =
0
$$

## A* Algorithm

**open lists (frontiers) & closed lists** : list containing nodes yet to be explored and nodes explored

- Dijkstra : expand frontier that is closest to $x_0$
- A* : expand frontier determined by the heuristic

**heuristic** : problem-solving approach that uses an estimate to guide decision making (efficiency > optimality)

**admissible heuristic** : satisfies ...

$$h(x_j) â‰¤ h^*(x_j)$$

... where ...

- $h(x_j)$ : the estimated cost from node $x_j$ to the goal
- $h^*(x_j)$ : the true cost from $x_j$ to the goal

**consistent heuristic** : if ...

$$h(x_i) <= C(x_i, x_j) + h(x_j); h(x_G) = 0$$

... and at the goal node ...

$$h(x_G) = 0$$

If $h(x)$ is both admissible and consistent, A* is guaranteed to find the optimal solution efficiently

**good heuristic** : 

- underestimate & satisfy triangle inequality
- heuristic is close to actual estimate = fast algorithm
- heuristic is close to 0 = slow algorithm

$h(x_i)$ = 0 = Dijkstra

---

**A\* Algorithm in a Nutshell** :

**1. Initialize** :

- Define the **open list** $O = \{x_o\}$ (starting node).
- Define the **closed list** $C = \{\}$ (empty set).
- Set the cost-to-come for the start node: $V(x_o) = 0$.
- Set the cost-to-come for all other nodes: $V(x_i) = \infty$.

**2. Repeat until the goal node $X_G$ is in the closed list $C$** :

- Select the node $x_j$ from $O$ with the **lowest total cost** (cost-to-come + heuristic).
- Remove $x_j$ from $O$ and add it to $C$ (mark it as explored).
- For each **neighbor $x_i$ of $x_j$** that is **not in $C$**:
  - Compute the new potential cost-to-come:  
    $V_{\text{new}} = C(x_j, x_i) + V(x_j)$
  - If $V_{\text{new}}$ is **lower** than the current $V(x_i)$, update $V(x_i)$.
  - If $x_i$ is not already in $O$, add it to $O$ (mark it for exploration).

Analyzing algorithms involve 3 factors :

- **completeness** : finds the optimal solution in finite time (if a solution exists)
  - DP
  - Dijkstra
  - A*
- **optimality** : finds a solution whose cost is the minimum/maximum
  - DP
  - Dijkstra
  - A*
- **efficiency** : finds the solution in the least possible time for all inputs
  - Dijksta and A* if no heuristic
  - A* with any admissible heuristic

**weighted A\*** : a variation of the A* search algorithm that prioritizes speed over optimality by using a weight to emphasize the heuristic function

---

**Weighted A\* Algorithm in a nutshell** :

**1. Initialize** :
- Define the **open list** $O = \{x_o\}$ (starting node).  
- Define the **closed list** $C = \{\}$ (empty set).  
- Set the **cost-to-come** for the start node: $V(x_o) = 0$.  
- Set the **cost-to-come** for all other nodes: $V(x_i) = \infin$.  

**2. Repeat until the goal node $X_G$ is in the closed list $C$** :
- Select the node $x_j$ from $O$ with the **lowest weighted total cost**:  
  $$  
  f_w(x_j) = V(x_j) + w \cdot h(x_j)  
  $$  
  where $w > 1$ is the weight.  
- Remove $x_j$ from $O$ and add it to $C$ (mark it as explored).  
- For each **neighbor $x_i$ of $x_j$** that is **not in $C$**:  
  - Compute the new potential cost-to-come:  
    $$  
    V_{\text{new}} = C(x_j, x_i) + V(x_j)  
    $$  
  - If $V_{\text{new}}$ is **lower** than the current $V(x_i)$, update $V(x_i)$.  
  - If $x_i$ is not already in $O$, add it to $O$ (mark it for exploration).  

---

The only difference is in the selection of $x_j$ where in A* we do ...

$$f(x) = V(x) + h(x)$$

... but in weighted A* we do ...

$$f_w(x) = V(x) + w * h(x)$$

... making the algorithm greedy and faster, but less optimal

We cannot guarantee optimality with weighted A*, but we can guarantee that it will find a path whose cost is no more than $\in$ times the minimum cost path

**anytime algorithm** : will return a good solution when being stop at any point in time

- more time == more optimal solution
- DP, Dijksta, and A* are not anytime algorithms
